This plugin adds several [Open Graph][1] tags to the header of your Wordpress site. These include meta information such as site name, a description (the excerpt of a post), the permalink, author, categories and images for your post. As a specialty, images from embedded video and audio players are retrieved as well. Other types of meta-tags are supported as well, including [Google+ Snippets][2], [Twitter Cards][3] and [canonical links][4].

Currently, these media embeds are supported:

* 8tracks
* Bambuser
* Bandcamp
* Blip.tv
* DailyMotion
* Flickr videos
* Hulu
* Internet Archive
* Justin.tv/Twitch.tv
* Livestream
* Mixcloud
* MyVideo
* Official.fm
* Rdio
* Socialcam
* SoundCloud
* Ustream
* Viddler
* Vimeo
* YouTube
* JW Player
* NVB Player
* Standard HTML5 video-tags

Open Graph tags will be used by social network sites such as Facebook, Twitter or Google+ to style a shared link or webpages "liked" by any user. Images supposedly attract more attention, so you might find this plug-in useful.
